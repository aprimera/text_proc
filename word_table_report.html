that sits on its hands while a major <b>american</b> city drowns before our eyes.</li><li>Tonight, I say to the <b>american</b> people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!</li><li>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the <b>american</b> promise alive.</li><li>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety <b>american</b>s are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."</li><li>These are the <b>american</b>s that I know.</li><li>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of <b>american</b>s.</li><li>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million <b>american</b>s?</li><li>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average <b>american</b> family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</li><li>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create <b>american</b> jobs, look out for <b>american</b> workers, and play by the rules of the road.</li><li>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every <b>american</b> who's willing to work.</li><li>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the <b>american</b> workers and small businesses who deserve it.</li><li>I'll make it easier for the <b>american</b> people to afford these new cars.</li><li>And we will keep our promise to every young <b>american</b> - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</li><li>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single <b>american</b>.</li><li>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of <b>american</b>s -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</li><li>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts <b>american</b> wages by hiring illegal workers.</li><li>Change happens because the <b>american</b> people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</li><li>Instead, it is that <b>american</b> spirit - that <b>american</b> promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</li><li>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought <b>american</b>s from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</li><li>Let us keep that promise - that <b>american</b> promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</li><li>These are <b>american</b>s who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.</li><li>These are <b>american</b>s who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.</li><li>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-<b>american</b> woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.</li><li>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been <b>american</b>s who refused.</li><li>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the <b>american</b> Dream.</li><li><b>american</b>s know this.</li><li>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every <b>american</b> an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.</li><li>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all <b>american</b>s.</li><li>The party that won't make <b>american</b>s choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.</li><li>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the <b>american</b> people about why we are there and how we will win.</li><li>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an <b>american</b> agenda.</li><li>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder <b>american</b>s.</li><li><b>american</b>s everywhere are desperate for leadership.</li><li>Our time to write a new chapter in the <b>american</b> story.</li><li>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in <b>american</b> history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.</li><li>Throughout <b>american</b> history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.</li><li>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the <b>american</b> people ?</li><li>A few Tuesdays ago, the <b>american</b> people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</li><li><b>american</b>s were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.</li><li>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the <b>american</b> people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</li><li>the <b>american</b> people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?</li><li>2,867 <b>american</b>s have now died in this war.</li><li>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before <b>american</b> troops arrived.</li><li>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, <b>american</b>s demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?</li><li>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of <b>american</b> troops from Iraqi soil.</li><li>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet <b>american</b> troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.</li><li>The addition of 4,000 <b>american</b> troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.</li><li>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on <b>american</b> soldiers.</li><li>“rejected the notion of an <b>american</b> ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered <b>american</b> commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped <b>american</b> soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the <b>american</b>s for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”<br>This is now the reality of Iraq.</li><li>And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of <b>american</b> resolve.</li><li>The <b>american</b> people have been extraordinarily resolved.</li><li>It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding <b>american</b> forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.</li><li>The <b>american</b> soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</li><li>Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put <b>american</b> troops in danger.</li><li>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and <b>american</b> enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</li><li>But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in <b>american</b> history.</li><li>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the <b>american</b> people.</li><li>According to a Pew survey, 42% of <b>american</b>s now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”<br>We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.</li><li><b>american</b>s called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.</li><li>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at <b>american</b> University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.</li></ul></td>

they are only realized once the personal and material security of a <b>people</b> is ensured as well.</li><li>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American <b>people</b>.</li><li>Now, few <b>people</b> understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.</li><li>Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- <b>people</b> like Col.

to pass until we bring an end to this war in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>Letting the <b>iraq</b>is know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.</li><li>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from <b>iraq</b> and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</li><li>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to <b>iraq</b> just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.</li><li>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from <b>iraq</b> has been echoed by the <b>iraq</b>i government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that <b>iraq</b> has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</li><li>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>I will end this war in <b>iraq</b> responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.</li><li>We've seen our children leave for <b>iraq</b> and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.</li><li>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in <b>iraq</b>, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.</li><li>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li><b>iraq</b> is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.</li><li>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in <b>iraq</b> to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.</li><li>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in <b>iraq</b> ?</li><li>The notion that <b>iraq</b> would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.</li><li>I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in <b>iraq</b> would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.</li><li>We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the <b>iraq</b>is stand up, we will be able to stand down.</li><li>Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from <b>iraq</b>i soil.</li><li>Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in <b>iraq</b>, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.</li><li>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan <b>iraq</b> Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.</li><li>Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 <b>iraq</b>is have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February.</li><li>300,000 <b>iraq</b>i security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.</li><li>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all <b>iraq</b>is now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers.</li><li>“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent <b>iraq</b>i political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in <b>iraq</b>.”<br>This is now the reality of <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>Now, I am hopeful that the <b>iraq</b> Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.</li><li>And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in <b>iraq</b>, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.</li><li>What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to <b>iraq</b>’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.</li><li>It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>namely, preventing <b>iraq</b> from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.</li><li>There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the <b>iraq</b>is from doing more on their own.</li><li>Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the <b>iraq</b>is, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.</li><li>The American soldiers I met when I traveled to <b>iraq</b> this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</li><li>They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>I have long said that the only solution in <b>iraq</b> is a political one.</li><li>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in <b>iraq</b> that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.</li><li>to pressure the <b>iraq</b>i leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.</li><li>The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the <b>iraq</b>i government ?</li><li>a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from <b>iraq</b> on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.</li><li>For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the <b>iraq</b>i factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?</li><li>that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>The President should announce to the <b>iraq</b>i people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.</li><li>When possible, this should be done in consultation with the <b>iraq</b>i government ?</li><li>but it should not depend on <b>iraq</b>i approval.</li><li>The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in <b>iraq</b> reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.</li><li>Drawing down our troops in <b>iraq</b> will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern <b>iraq</b> and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.</li><li>This force could help prevent the conflict in <b>iraq</b> from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern <b>iraq</b>, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.</li><li>The President’s decision to go to war in <b>iraq</b> has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.</li><li>By redeploying from <b>iraq</b> to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.</li><li>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in <b>iraq</b> should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</li><li>In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in <b>iraq</b> for a more extended period of time.</li><li>But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among <b>iraq</b>i factions; if the <b>iraq</b>i government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the <b>iraq</b>i government asked us ?</li><li>We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in <b>iraq</b>, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the <b>iraq</b>i state and further polarization of <b>iraq</b>i society.</li><li>The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the <b>iraq</b>i security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?</li><li>who are deployed with <b>iraq</b>i as units advisers.</li><li>An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of <b>iraq</b>i units; develop the trust and goodwill of <b>iraq</b>i soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.</li><li>any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in <b>iraq</b> to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified <b>iraq</b>i government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.</li><li>Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the <b>iraq</b>i government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.</li><li>We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the <b>iraq</b>i government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.</li><li>The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in <b>iraq</b> with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.</li><li>So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in <b>iraq</b>.</li><li>Today, the <b>iraq</b>i landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the <b>iraq</b>i people or stabilize the country.</li><li>We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put <b>iraq</b>is to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.</li><li>But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of <b>iraq</b>is to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.</li><li>Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of <b>iraq</b>, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.</li><li>But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in <b>iraq</b> filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?</li><li>And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the <b>iraq</b>is, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.</li><li>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of <b>iraq</b>, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various <b>iraq</b>i factions towards a political solution.</li><li>if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use <b>iraq</b> as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.</li><li>As we change strategy in <b>iraq</b>, we should also think about what <b>iraq</b>

      <td><ul><li>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better <b>america</b>.</li><li>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is <b>america</b> converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.</li><li>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the <b>america</b>n people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful <b>america</b>.</li><li>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as <b>america</b>ns.</li><li>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety <b>america</b>ns feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.</li><li>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across <b>america</b>.</li><li>Let's make it possible for hardworking <b>america</b>ns to save for retirement.</li><li>Let's be the generation that ends poverty in <b>america</b>.</li><li>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in <b>america</b> by the end of the next president's first term.</li><li>Let's be the generation that finally frees <b>america</b> from the tyranny of oil.</li><li><b>america</b>, it's time to start bringing our troops home.</li><li>It's time to admit that no amount of <b>america</b>n lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.</li><li>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better <b>america</b>.</li><li>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working <b>america</b>ns and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.</li><li>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in <b>america</b>, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</li><li>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one <b>america</b>n family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</li><li>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the <b>america</b>n promise has been threatened once more.</li><li>Tonight, more <b>america</b>ns are out of work and more are working harder for less.</li><li><b>america</b>, we are better than these last eight years.</li><li>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major <b>america</b>n city drowns before our eyes.</li><li>Tonight, I say to the <b>america</b>n people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!</li><li>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the <b>america</b>n promise alive.</li><li>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety <b>america</b>ns are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."</li><li>These are the <b>america</b>ns that I know.</li><li>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of <b>america</b>ns.</li><li>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million <b>america</b>ns?</li><li>It's time for us to change <b>america</b>.</li><li>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average <b>america</b>n family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</li><li>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create <b>america</b>n jobs, look out for <b>america</b>n workers, and play by the rules of the road.</li><li>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every <b>america</b>n who's willing to work.</li><li>That's the promise of <b>america</b> - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</li><li>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the <b>america</b>n workers and small businesses who deserve it.</li><li>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in <b>america</b>.</li><li>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in <b>america</b>.</li><li>I'll make it easier for the <b>america</b>n people to afford these new cars.</li><li><b>america</b>, now is not the time for small plans.</li><li>And I will not settle for an <b>america</b> where some kids don't have that chance.</li><li>And we will keep our promise to every young <b>america</b>n - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</li><li>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single <b>america</b>n.</li><li>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in <b>america</b> should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</li><li>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help <b>america</b> grow.</li><li>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling <b>america</b>'s promise will require more than just money.</li><li>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of <b>america</b>'s promise.</li><li>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep <b>america</b>'s promise abroad.</li><li>That won't keep <b>america</b> safe.</li><li>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of <b>america</b>ns -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</li><li>And I will restore our moral standing, so that <b>america</b> is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</li><li>They have not served a Red <b>america</b> or a Blue <b>america</b> - they have served the United States of <b>america</b>.</li><li><b>america</b>, our work will not be easy.</li><li>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts <b>america</b>n wages by hiring illegal workers.</li><li>This too is part of <b>america</b>'s promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</li><li>But I stand before you tonight because all across <b>america</b> something is stirring.</li><li>Change happens because the <b>america</b>n people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</li><li><b>america</b>, this is one of those moments.</li><li>Instead, it is that <b>america</b>n spirit - that <b>america</b>n promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</li><li>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought <b>america</b>ns from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</li><li>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in <b>america</b>, our destiny is inextricably linked.</li><li><b>america</b>, we cannot turn back.</li><li><b>america</b>, we cannot turn back.</li><li>Let us keep that promise - that <b>america</b>n promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</li><li>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of <b>america</b>.</li><li>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive <b>america</b>.</li><li>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in <b>america</b>'s history.</li><li>These are <b>america</b>ns who still believe in an <b>america</b> where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.</li><li>These are <b>america</b>ns who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.</li><li>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-<b>america</b>n woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.</li><li>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as <b>america</b>.</li><li>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for <b>america</b>.</li><li>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been <b>america</b>ns who refused.</li><li>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the <b>america</b>n Dream.</li><li>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround <b>america</b> to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.</li><li>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back <b>america</b> conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.</li><li><b>america</b>ns know this.</li><li>That's what <b>america</b> is.</li><li>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every <b>america</b>n an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.</li><li>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all <b>america</b>ns.</li><li>The party that won't make <b>america</b>ns choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.</li><li>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent <b>america</b>.</li><li>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the <b>america</b>n people about why we are there and how we will win.</li><li>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an <b>america</b>n agenda.</li><li>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder <b>america</b>ns.</li><li><b>america</b>ns everywhere are desperate for leadership.</li><li>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across <b>america</b>.</li><li>Our time to write a new chapter in the <b>america</b>n story.</li><li>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when <b>america</b> renewed its purpose.</li><li>They can say that this was the time when <b>america</b> found its way.</li><li>They can say that this was the time when <b>america</b> learned to dream again.</li><li>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in <b>america</b>n history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.</li><li>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from <b>america</b> when I was still young.</li><li>Throughout <b>america</b>n history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.</li><li>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the <b>america</b>n people ?</li><li>A few Tuesdays ago, the <b>america</b>n people embraced this seriousness with regards to <b>america</b>’s policy in Iraq.</li><li><b>america</b>ns were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.</li><li>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the <b>america</b>n people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</li><li>the <b>america</b>n people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?</li><li>2,867 <b>america</b>ns have now died in this war.</li><li>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before <b>america</b>n troops arrived.</li><li>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on <b>america</b>.</li><li>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, <b>america</b>ns demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?</li><li>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of <b>america</b>n troops from Iraqi soil.</li><li>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet <b>america</b>n troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.</li><li>The addition of 4,000 <b>america</b>n troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.</li><li>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on <b>america</b>n soldiers.</li><li>“rejected the notion of an <b>america</b>n ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered <b>america</b>n commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped <b>america</b>n soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the <b>america</b>ns for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”<br>This is now the reality of Iraq.</li><li>And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of <b>america</b>n resolve.</li><li>The <b>america</b>n people have been extraordinarily resolved.</li><li>It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding <b>america</b>n forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.</li><li>The <b>america</b>n soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</li><li>Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put <b>america</b>n troops in danger.</li><li>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and <b>america</b>n enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</li><li>But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in <b>america</b>n history.</li><li>As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about <b>america</b>’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.</li><li>We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats <b>america</b> now faces ?</li><li>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the <b>america</b>n people.</li><li>According to a Pew survey, 42% of <b>america</b>ns now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”<br>We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.</li><li><b>america</b>ns called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.</li><li>And it is time to refocus <b>america</b>’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.</li><li>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at <b>america</b>n University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.</li></ul></td>

students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.</li><li>America, we are better than these last eight <b>year</b>s.</li><li>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty <b>year</b>s and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</li><li>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four <b>year</b>s look like the last eight.</li><li>Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a <b>year</b>?</li><li>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite <b>year</b>s of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.</li><li>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten <b>year</b>s, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</li><li>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty <b>year</b>s, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.</li><li>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who <b>year</b>n for a better future.</li><li>For part of what has been lost these past eight <b>year</b>s can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.</li><li>And it is that promise that forty five <b>year</b>s ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</li><li>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few <b>year</b>s, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.</li><li>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 <b>year</b>s old.</li><li>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-<b>year</b>-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.</li><li>In a century just six <b>year</b>s old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.</li><li>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six <b>year</b>s, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:<br>Had enough?</li><li>Four <b>year</b>s after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.</li><li>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty <b>year</b>s in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.</li><li>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-<b>year</b>-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?</li><li>I had just finished three <b>year</b>s of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.</li><li>My sister, Auma, was teaching that <b>year</b> at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month.</li><li>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten <b>year</b>s old.</li><li>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many <b>year</b>s.</li><li>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 <b>year</b>s old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.</li><li>In just the last <b>year</b>, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.</li><li>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last <b>year</b>'s referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.</li><li>And now, after three long <b>year</b>s of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</li><li>Month after month, and then <b>year</b> after <b>year</b>, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.</li><li>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a <b>year</b> ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.</li><li>Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a <b>year</b> of significant transition in Iraq.</li><li>What we have seen instead is a <b>year</b> of significant deterioration.</li><li>A <b>year</b> in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.</li><li>A <b>year</b> that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.</li><li>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two <b>year</b>s, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.</li><li>The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this <b>year</b> were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</li><li>When I first advocated steps along these lines over a <b>year</b> ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.</li><li>I spoke here a <b>year</b> ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.</li><li>I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a <b>year</b> from now and say the same thing.</li><li>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten <b>year</b>s - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.</li><li>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and <b>year</b>s to come?</li><li>In the <b>year</b>s ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.</li><li>For <b>year</b>s, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.</li><li>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty <b>year</b>s to dismantle these weapons.</li><li>Additionally, in the last few <b>year</b>s, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.</li></ul></td>

that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</li><li>Whether it's the <b>war</b> or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.</li><li>I've thought about how she lived to see a world <b>war</b> and a Great Depression and a second world <b>war</b>, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those <b>war</b>s and still have to sit at the back of a bus.</li><li>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by <b>war</b> and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.</li><li>And when we do go to <b>war</b>, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.</li><li>To begin with, I discovered the <b>war</b>mth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.</li><li>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of <b>war</b> or ethnic conflict.</li><li>It can shield a <b>war</b> criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.</li><li>Instead of unifying the country to move for<b>war</b>d on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.</li><li>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations to<b>war</b>ds a better future.</li><li>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to <b>war</b> in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.</li><li>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the <b>war</b> on terror as a political football are over.</li><li>2,867 Americans have now died in this <b>war</b>.</li><li>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the <b>war</b> in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its <b>war</b> on America.</li><li>This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this <b>war</b>, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.</li><li>The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bul<b>war</b>k of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.</li><li>I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a <b>war</b> in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.</li><li>Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this <b>war</b>’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.</li><li>When I came here and gave a speech on this <b>war</b> a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move to<b>war</b>ds a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.</li><li>A year in which well-respected Republicans like John <b>war</b>ner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.</li><li>According to our own Pentagon, the situation on the ground is now pointing to<b>war</b>ds chaos.</li><li>And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided <b>war</b>.</li><li>For the fact is that there are no good options left in this <b>war</b>.</li><li>And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this <b>war</b> is simply a matter of American resolve.</li><li>And, while some have proposed escalating this <b>war</b> by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.</li><li>Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil <b>war</b>.</li><li>But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this <b>war</b>.</li><li>to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the <b>war</b>ring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.</li><li>This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider <b>war</b>, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.</li><li>The President’s decision to go to <b>war</b> in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.</li><li>Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding to<b>war</b>ds chaos.</li><li>But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement to<b>war</b>ds a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?</li><li>The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress to<b>war</b>d a political settlement.</li><li>This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this <b>war</b>.</li><li>But we need to also move to<b>war</b>ds more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.</li><li>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil <b>war</b>, and push the various Iraqi factions to<b>war</b>ds a political solution.</li><li>Many who supported the original decision to go to <b>war</b> in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.</li><li>that the rationale behind the <b>war</b> itself was misguided.</li><li>And so going for<b>war</b>d, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.</li><li>The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for <b>war</b>; you must also plan for success.</li><li>The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the <b>war</b> is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.</li><li>Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold <b>war</b>.</li><li>Throughout the Cold <b>war</b>, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ <b>war</b>fare.</li><li>Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical <b>war</b>fare against U.S. troops.</li><li>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early <b>war</b>ning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.</li><li>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move for<b>war</b>d, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.</li></ul></td>

a <b>threat</b> we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.</li><li>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative <b>threat</b> Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.</li><li>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this <b>threat</b> in the days and years to come?</li><li>First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation <b>threat</b>s from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.</li><li>Yet, a serious <b>threat</b> still remains.</li><li>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation <b>threat</b> they pose.</li><li>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons <b>threat</b> reduction programs.</li><li>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative <b>threat</b> Reduction program.</li><li>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation <b>threat</b>.</li><li>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism <b>threat</b>s.</li><li>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the <b>threat</b>.</li><li>As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological <b>threat</b>s.</li><li>But when we think about the <b>threat</b> that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.</li><li>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative <b>threat</b> Reduction effort.</li><li>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative <b>threat</b> Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.</li><li>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological <b>threat</b> reduction.</li><li>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about <b>threat</b>s posed by the Soviet Union.</li></ul></td>

if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among <b>iraqi</b> factions; if the <b>iraqi</b> government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the <b>iraqi</b> government asked us ?</li><li>We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the <b>iraqi</b> state and further polarization of <b>iraqi</b> society.</li><li>The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the <b>iraqi</b> security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?</li><li>who are deployed with <b>iraqi</b> as units advisers.</li><li>An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of <b>iraqi</b> units; develop the trust and goodwill of <b>iraqi</b> soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.</li><li>In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified <b>iraqi</b> government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.</li><li>Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the <b>iraqi</b> government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.</li><li>We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the <b>iraqi</b> government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.</li><li>Today, the <b>iraqi</b> landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the <b>iraqi</b> people or stabilize the country.</li><li>We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put <b>iraqi</b>s to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.</li><li>But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of <b>iraqi</b>s to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.</li><li>And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the <b>iraqi</b>s, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.</li><li>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various <b>iraqi</b> factions towards a political solution.</li><li>It is time to give <b>iraqi</b>s their country back.</li></ul></td>

the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one <b>nation</b>; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</li><li>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this <b>nation</b>, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</li><li>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimi<b>nation</b>.</li><li>This country of ours has more wealth than any <b>nation</b>, but that's not what makes us rich.</li><li>And how she watched FDR lift this <b>nation</b> out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.</li><li>She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a <b>nation</b>.</li><li>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against <b>nation</b>-building.</li><li>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving <b>nation</b>al problems is because they think government is the problem.</li><li>Yes, our greatness as a <b>nation</b> has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.</li><li>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a <b>nation</b>, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.</li><li>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new <b>nation</b>.</li><li>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determi<b>nation</b> in the face of great odds.</li><li>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross <b>nation</b>al product was not very different from that of South Korea.</li><li>Kenya, like many African <b>nation</b>s did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.</li><li>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of <b>nation</b>al boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.</li><li>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized <b>nation</b>.</li><li>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own <b>nation</b> more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.</li><li>When African <b>nation</b>s were just gaining independence, industrialized <b>nation</b>s had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the inter<b>nation</b>al financial system.</li><li>As a result, many African <b>nation</b>s have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.</li><li>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other <b>nation</b>s, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.</li><li>It cannot wait for other <b>nation</b>s to act first.</li><li>The hard truth is that <b>nation</b>s, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.</li><li>Like many <b>nation</b>s across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.</li><li>Among African <b>nation</b>s, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.</li><li>Some of the worst actors on the inter<b>nation</b>al stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.</li><li>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great <b>nation</b>s towards a better future.</li><li>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the <b>nation</b> and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ?</li><li>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of inter<b>nation</b>al terrorism.</li><li>Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with inter<b>nation</b>al terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.</li><li>money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a <b>nation</b>.</li><li>This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to inter<b>nation</b>al terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.</li><li>We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the <b>nation</b>al government.</li><li>It is in our <b>nation</b>al interest to prevent this from happening.</li><li>We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat inter<b>nation</b>al terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</li><li>As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and inter<b>nation</b>al terrorism.</li><li>The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of inter<b>nation</b>al terrorism ?</li><li>and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many <b>nation</b>s.</li><li>The <b>nation</b>al Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.</li><li>According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business inter<b>nation</b>ally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”<br>We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.</li><li>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the inter<b>nation</b>al community.</li><li>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimi<b>nation</b> of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.</li><li>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our <b>nation</b>al security.</li></ul></td>

      <td><ul><li>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from <b>kenya</b> and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</li><li>And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from <b>kenya</b>.</li><li>The first time I came to <b>kenya</b> was in 1987.</li><li>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of <b>kenya</b> possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.</li><li>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of <b>kenya</b>'s liberation struggles.</li><li>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to <b>kenya</b>.</li><li>His ideas about how <b>kenya</b> should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.</li><li>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of <b>kenya</b>, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.</li><li>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and <b>kenya</b>tta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.</li><li>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither <b>kenya</b> nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.</li><li>In early 1960's, as <b>kenya</b> was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea.</li><li>Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than <b>kenya</b>'s.</li><li>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary <b>kenya</b>ns - we know how hard <b>kenya</b>ns are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that <b>kenya</b>n mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that <b>kenya</b>n fathers make for their families.</li><li><b>kenya</b>, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.</li><li><b>kenya</b> was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.</li><li>Third, <b>kenya</b> is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.</li><li>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with <b>kenya</b> and with Africa.</li><li>But, <b>kenya</b> must do its part.</li><li>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if <b>kenya</b> does not act, it will fall behind.</li><li>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why <b>kenya</b> lags behind.</li><li>Like many nations across this continent, where <b>kenya</b> is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.</li><li>There is no doubt that what <b>kenya</b>ns have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring.</li><li>Among African nations, <b>kenya</b> remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.</li><li>It's not just a <b>kenya</b>n problem, or an African problem.</li><li>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in <b>kenya</b> it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.</li><li>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of <b>kenya</b>ns still live in poverty.</li><li>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in <b>kenya</b> costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in <b>kenya</b> or somewhere else.</li><li>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed <b>kenya</b>n blood and struck at the heart of the <b>kenya</b>n economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of <b>kenya</b>ns walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.</li><li>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in <b>kenya</b>.</li><li>The <b>kenya</b>n media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.</li><li>Today, we're starting to see that the <b>kenya</b>n people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.</li><li>The <b>kenya</b>n people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many <b>kenya</b>ns seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.</li><li>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your <b>kenya</b>n brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.</li><li>The <b>kenya</b>n people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.</li><li>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened <b>kenya</b>.</li><li>As well as numerous <b>kenya</b>n men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.</li><li>And then there are anonymous <b>kenya</b>n whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.</li><li>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of <b>kenya</b>n culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.</li><li>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger <b>kenya</b> where everyone rises together.</li><li>This is the <b>kenya</b> that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.</li><li>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to <b>kenya</b> from America when I was still young.</li><li>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in <b>kenya</b> on my last trip to this country.</li><li>In today's <b>kenya</b> - a <b>kenya</b> already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.</li></ul></td>

said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more <b>troop</b>s to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.</li><li>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our <b>troop</b>s from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</li><li>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our <b>troop</b>s into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</li><li>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our <b>troop</b>s and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.</li><li>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American <b>troop</b>s arrived.</li><li>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American <b>troop</b>s from Iraqi soil.</li><li>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American <b>troop</b> levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.</li><li>The addition of 4,000 American <b>troop</b>s in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.</li><li>namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our <b>troop</b>s can come home.</li><li>And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more <b>troop</b>s, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.</li><li>It’s not clear that these <b>troop</b> levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.</li><li>Our <b>troop</b>s can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.</li><li>And all the <b>troop</b>s in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.</li><li>a phased redeployment of U.S. <b>troop</b>s from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.</li><li>We cannot compromise the safety of our <b>troop</b>s, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.</li><li>The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain <b>troop</b> levels.</li><li>Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American <b>troop</b>s in danger.</li><li>Drawing down our <b>troop</b>s in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional <b>troop</b>s to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.</li><li>This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our <b>troop</b>s to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.</li><li>Perhaps most importantly, some of these <b>troop</b>s could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.</li><li>By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more <b>troop</b>s and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.</li><li>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. <b>troop</b>s remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</li><li>We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our <b>troop</b>s stabilize key areas.</li><li>If we commit our <b>troop</b>s anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our <b>troop</b>s home.</li><li>The overwhelming presence of our <b>troop</b>s, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.</li><li>Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. <b>troop</b>s.</li></ul></td>

connections.</li><li>My work took me to some of Chica<b>go</b>'s poorest neighborhoods.</li><li>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no <b>go</b>vernment could ever fill.</li><li>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of <b>go</b>vernment that can be changed.</li><li>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our <b>go</b>vernment into a game only they can afford to play.</li><li>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this <b>go</b>vernment, but we're here today to take it back.</li><li>But Washington has a long way to <b>go</b>.</li><li>And although <b>go</b>vernment will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to <b>go</b>.</li><li>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to <b>go</b> when they work.</li><li>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've <b>go</b>t.</li><li>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make <b>go</b>od on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.</li><li>Four years a<b>go</b>, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</li><li>These challenges are not all of <b>go</b>vernment's making.</li><li>We are more compassionate than a <b>go</b>vernment that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</li><li>They work hard and give back and keep <b>go</b>ing without complaint.</li><li>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's <b>go</b>ing on in the lives of Americans.</li><li>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income <b>go</b> up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</li><li>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a <b>go</b>od idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</li><li>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to <b>go</b> to college on the GI Bill.</li><li>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chica<b>go</b> who I stood by and fought for two decades a<b>go</b> after the local steel plant closed.</li><li>Ours is a promise that says <b>go</b>vernment cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</li><li>Our <b>go</b>vernment should work for us, not against us.</li><li>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create <b>go</b>od jobs right here in America.</li><li>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear <b>go</b>al as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</li><li>But I will also <b>go</b> through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.</li><li>Yes, <b>go</b>vernment must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.</li><li>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that <b>go</b>vernment can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</li><li>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even <b>go</b> to the cave where he lives.</li><li>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</li><li>So I've <b>go</b>t news for you, John McCain.</li><li>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about <b>go</b>vernment.</li><li>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up <b>go</b>vernment and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</li><li>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who <b>go</b>t involved again after a very long time.</li><li>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the <b>go</b>od neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</li><li>And it is that promise that forty five years a<b>go</b> today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</li><li>Thank you, and <b>go</b>d Bless the United States of America.</li><li>It's a time where you can <b>go</b> to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.</li><li>These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have for<b>go</b>tten how.</li><li>And I'd have to explain that I <b>go</b>t the name from my father, who was from Kenya.</li><li>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna <b>go</b> into something dirty and nasty like politics?"</li><li>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that <b>go</b>vernment can make a difference in our lives.</li><li>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chica<b>go</b>, which is where I live.</li><li>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she <b>go</b>t in that line - and she never for<b>go</b>t it.</li><li>Who said we're <b>go</b>ing to keep on dreaming, and we're <b>go</b>ing to keep on building, and we're <b>go</b>ing to keep on marching, and we're <b>go</b>ing to keep on working because that's who we are.</li><li>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our <b>go</b>vernment.</li><li>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and <b>go</b>vernment and people and places all over the globe.</li><li>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily <b>go</b> to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.</li><li>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs <b>go</b> overseas.</li><li>But while the world has changed around us, too often our <b>go</b>vernment has stood still.</li><li>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll <b>go</b> away.</li><li>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable <b>go</b>ods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams.</li><li>Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not <b>go</b>nna settle anymore.</li><li>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks a<b>go</b>.</li><li>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done <b>go</b>verning this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:<br>Had enough?</li><li>Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of <b>go</b>vernance.</li><li>I've had enough of our kids <b>go</b>ing to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.</li><li>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the <b>go</b>od fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.</li><li>The reason they don't believe <b>go</b>vernment has a role in solving national problems is because they think <b>go</b>vernment is the problem.</li><li>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to <b>go</b> buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...</li><li>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's <b>go</b>t a shot at opportunity.</li><li>We know that <b>go</b>vernment can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.</li><li>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, syna<b>go</b>gues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.</li><li>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the <b>go</b>vernment and one that bankrupts families.</li><li>And when we do <b>go</b> to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.</li><li>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest <b>go</b>vernment that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.</li><li>A while a<b>go</b>, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.</li><li>I'm trying to <b>go</b> to college.</li><li>I don't need to sew to <b>go</b> to college.</li><li>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chica<b>go</b>, and was about to enroll in law school.</li><li>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Ale<b>go</b>, near Siaya, during this period of tumult.</li><li>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding <b>go</b>ats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.</li><li>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a <b>go</b>vernment that is transparent and accountable.</li><li>My own city of Chica<b>go</b> has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.</li><li>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between <b>go</b>od-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.</li><li>In the end, if the people cannot trust their <b>go</b>vernment to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.</li><li>The <b>go</b>od news is that there are already signs of progress here.</li><li>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vi<b>go</b>r of the investigation into the <b>go</b>ldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.</li><li>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a <b>go</b>vernment treats its people.</li><li>And we also know that the more people there are on the <b>go</b>vernment payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.</li><li>So if the <b>go</b>vernment found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other <b>go</b>vernment officials.</li><li>And the way to create <b>go</b>od jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to <b>go</b> about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.</li><li>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary <b>go</b>al of any <b>go</b>vernment suffering from corruption.</li><li>Wealth declarations do little <b>go</b>od if no one can access them, and accountability in <b>go</b>vernment spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.</li><li>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the <b>go</b>al of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public <b>go</b>od.</li><li>An accountable, transparent <b>go</b>vernment can break this cycle.</li><li>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githon<b>go</b>, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.</li><li>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyan<b>go</b>, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.</li><li>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been <b>go</b>od judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?</li><li>A few Tuesdays a<b>go</b>, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</li><li>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to <b>go</b> to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.</li><li>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks a<b>go</b>, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined <b>go</b>als in Iraq ?</li><li>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year a<b>go</b>, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.</li><li>According to our own Penta<b>go</b>n, the situation on the ground is now pointing towards chaos.</li><li>For the fact is that there are no <b>go</b>od options left in this war.</li><li>Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect <b>go</b>vernment are now just that ?</li><li>The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment ?</li><li>When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year a<b>go</b>, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.</li><li>For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not <b>go</b>ing to hold together this country indefinitely ?</li><li>that it will be up to them to form a viable <b>go</b>vernment that can effectively run and secure Iraq.</li><li>When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment ?</li><li>The President’s decision to <b>go</b> to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.</li><li>Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai <b>go</b>vernment, we are backsliding towards chaos.</li><li>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and <b>go</b> after terrorists.</li><li>But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment asked us ?</li><li>An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and <b>go</b>odwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.</li><li>In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.</li><li>Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.</li><li>We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi <b>go</b>vernment will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national <b>go</b>vernment.</li><li>The <b>go</b>al of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.</li><li>Many who supported the original decision to <b>go</b> to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.</li><li>And so <b>go</b>ing forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.</li><li>In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak <b>go</b>vernments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.</li><li>and that is the loss of our <b>go</b>vernment’s credibility with the American people.</li><li>Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays a<b>go</b>.</li><li>I spoke here a year a<b>go</b> and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.</li><li> <b>go</b>od morning.</li><li>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-<b>go</b>vernmental organizations, and the international community.</li><li>Fortunately, however, we've made some <b>go</b>od progress on this front.</li><li>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that <b>go</b>vernment, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.</li><li>While the <b>go</b>vernment of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.</li><li>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when ne<b>go</b>tiating with the Russians.</li><li>It's important for senior officials to <b>go</b> and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.</li></ul></td>

on health <b>ca</b>re and edu<b>ca</b>tion and the economy - Senator Mc<b>ca</b>in has been anything but independent.</li><li>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Ameri<b>ca</b>ns are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."</li><li>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, be<b>ca</b>use they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.</li><li>These are the Ameri<b>ca</b>ns that I know.</li><li>Now, I don't believe that Senator Mc<b>ca</b>in doesn't <b>ca</b>re what's going on in the lives of Ameri<b>ca</b>ns.</li><li>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Ameri<b>ca</b>ns?</li><li>How else could he offer a health <b>ca</b>re plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an edu<b>ca</b>tion plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</li><li>It's not be<b>ca</b>use John Mc<b>ca</b>in doesn't <b>ca</b>re.</li><li>It's be<b>ca</b>use John Mc<b>ca</b>in doesn't get it.</li><li>For over two de<b>ca</b>des, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republi<b>ca</b>n philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.</li><li>In Washington, they <b>ca</b>ll this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own.</li><li>No health <b>ca</b>re?</li><li>It's time for us to change Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>We measure progress by how many people <b>ca</b>n find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you <b>ca</b>n put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you <b>ca</b>n someday watch your child receive her college diploma.</li><li>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average Ameri<b>ca</b>n family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</li><li>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea <b>ca</b>n take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips <b>ca</b>n take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</li><li>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chi<b>ca</b>go who I stood by and fought for two de<b>ca</b>des ago after the lo<b>ca</b>l steel plant closed.</li><li>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions be<b>ca</b>use she was a woman.</li><li>She's the one who put off buying a new <b>ca</b>r or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life.</li><li>And although she <b>ca</b>n no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</li><li>I don't know what kind of lives John Mc<b>ca</b>in thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.</li><li>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create Ameri<b>ca</b>n jobs, look out for Ameri<b>ca</b>n workers, and play by the rules of the road.</li><li>Ours is a promise that says government <b>ca</b>nnot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we <b>ca</b>nnot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent edu<b>ca</b>tion; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</li><li>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every Ameri<b>ca</b>n who's willing to work.</li><li>That's the promise of Ameri<b>ca</b> - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</li><li>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the Ameri<b>ca</b>n workers and small businesses who deserve it.</li><li>Unlike John Mc<b>ca</b>in, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>I will eliminate <b>ca</b>pital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</li><li>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John Mc<b>ca</b>in has been there for twenty-six of them.</li><li>In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for <b>ca</b>rs, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.</li><li>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator Mc<b>ca</b>in took office.</li><li>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient <b>ca</b>rs of the future are built right here in Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>I'll make it easier for the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people to afford these new <b>ca</b>rs.</li><li>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next de<b>ca</b>de in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and <b>ca</b>n't ever be outsourced.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>, now is not the time for small plans.</li><li>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class edu<b>ca</b>tion, be<b>ca</b>use it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.</li><li>Michelle and I are only here tonight be<b>ca</b>use we were given a chance at an edu<b>ca</b>tion.</li><li>And I will not settle for an Ameri<b>ca</b> where some kids don't have that chance.</li><li>I'll invest in early childhood edu<b>ca</b>tion.</li><li>And we will keep our promise to every young Ameri<b>ca</b>n - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you <b>ca</b>n afford a college edu<b>ca</b>tion.</li><li>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health <b>ca</b>re for every single Ameri<b>ca</b>n.</li><li>If you have health <b>ca</b>re, my plan will lower your premiums.</li><li>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of <b>ca</b>ncer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need <b>ca</b>re the most.</li><li>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, be<b>ca</b>use nobody in Ameri<b>ca</b> should have to choose between keeping their jobs and <b>ca</b>ring for a sick child or ailing parent.</li><li>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, be<b>ca</b>use I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</li><li>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help Ameri<b>ca</b> grow.</li><li>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - be<b>ca</b>use we <b>ca</b>nnot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.</li><li>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling Ameri<b>ca</b>'s promise will require more than just money.</li><li>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy <b>ca</b>lled our "intellectual and moral strength."</li><li>But we must also admit that programs alone <b>ca</b>n't replace parents; that government <b>ca</b>n't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</li><li>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of Ameri<b>ca</b>'s promise.</li><li>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep Ameri<b>ca</b>'s promise abroad.</li><li>If John Mc<b>ca</b>in wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</li><li>For while Senator Mc<b>ca</b>in was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.</li><li>When John Mc<b>ca</b>in said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.</li><li>John Mc<b>ca</b>in likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the <b>ca</b>ve where he lives.</li><li>And today, as my <b>ca</b>ll for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John Mc<b>ca</b>in stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</li><li>That won't keep Ameri<b>ca</b> safe.</li><li>We need a President who <b>ca</b>n face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</li><li>You <b>ca</b>n't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.</li><li>If John Mc<b>ca</b>in wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</li><li>The Bush-Mc<b>ca</b>in foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Ameri<b>ca</b>ns -- Democrats and Republi<b>ca</b>ns - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</li><li>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the <b>ca</b>re and benefits they deserve when they come home.</li><li>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that <b>ca</b>n prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.</li><li>And I will restore our moral standing, so that Ameri<b>ca</b> is once again that last, best hope for all who are <b>ca</b>lled to the <b>ca</b>use of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</li><li>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John Mc<b>ca</b>in.</li><li>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for politi<b>ca</b>l purposes.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people <b>ca</b>nnot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</li><li>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John Mc<b>ca</b>in.</li><li>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republi<b>ca</b>ns and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.</li><li>They have not served a Red Ameri<b>ca</b> or a Blue Ameri<b>ca</b> - they have served the United States of Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>So I've got news for you, John Mc<b>ca</b>in.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>, our work will not be easy.</li><li>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republi<b>ca</b>ns will need to <b>ca</b>st off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.</li><li>For part of what has been lost these past eight years <b>ca</b>n't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.</li><li>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we <b>ca</b>n agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.</li><li>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we <b>ca</b>n't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.</li><li>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we <b>ca</b>n agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.</li><li>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts Ameri<b>ca</b>n wages by hiring illegal workers.</li><li>This too is part of Ameri<b>ca</b>'s promise - the promise of a democracy where we <b>ca</b>n find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to s<b>ca</b>re the voters.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.</li><li>I realize that I am not the likeliest <b>ca</b>ndidate for this office.</li><li>I don't fit the typi<b>ca</b>l pedigree, and I haven't spent my <b>ca</b>reer in the halls of Washington.</li><li>But I stand before you tonight be<b>ca</b>use all across Ameri<b>ca</b> something is stirring.</li><li>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we <b>ca</b>n take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.</li><li>Change happens be<b>ca</b>use the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people demand it - be<b>ca</b>use they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>, this is one of those moments.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use I've seen it.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use I've lived it.</li><li>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health <b>ca</b>re to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.</li><li>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better <b>ca</b>re for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</li><li>And I've seen it in this <b>ca</b>mpaign.</li><li>In the Republi<b>ca</b>ns who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.</li><li>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurri<b>ca</b>ne strikes and the floodwaters rise.</li><li>Instead, it is that Ameri<b>ca</b>n spirit - that Ameri<b>ca</b>n promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</li><li>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Ameri<b>ca</b>ns from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</li><li>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in Ameri<b>ca</b>, our destiny is inextri<b>ca</b>bly linked.</li><li>That together, our dreams <b>ca</b>n be one.</li><li>"We <b>ca</b>nnot walk alone," the preacher cried.</li><li>We <b>ca</b>nnot turn back."</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>, we <b>ca</b>nnot turn back.</li><li>Not with so many children to edu<b>ca</b>te, and so many veterans to <b>ca</b>re for.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>, we <b>ca</b>nnot turn back.</li><li>We <b>ca</b>nnot walk alone.</li><li>Let us keep that promise - that Ameri<b>ca</b>n promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</li><li>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the <b>ca</b>use of a more progressive Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in Ameri<b>ca</b>'s history.</li><li>It's a time where you <b>ca</b>n go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.</li><li>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health <b>ca</b>re or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.</li><li>These are Ameri<b>ca</b>ns who still believe in an Ameri<b>ca</b> where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.</li><li>These are Ameri<b>ca</b>ns who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.</li><li>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a <b>ca</b>mpaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use people just couldn't pronounce it.</li><li>They'd <b>ca</b>ll me "Alabama," or they'd <b>ca</b>ll me "Yo Mama."</li><li>And I understood the question be<b>ca</b>use it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.</li><li>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government <b>ca</b>n make a difference in our lives.</li><li>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chi<b>ca</b>go, which is where I live.</li><li>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old Afri<b>ca</b>n-Ameri<b>ca</b>n woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally be<b>ca</b>use she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.</li><li>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't <b>ca</b>rs on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.</li><li>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children be<b>ca</b>use they walked for freedom.</li><li>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters be<b>ca</b>use they believed.</li><li>She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and <b>ca</b>talyze a nation.</li><li>She kept on voting in each and every election be<b>ca</b>use she believed.</li><li>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Ameri<b>ca</b>ns who refused.</li><li>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working be<b>ca</b>use that's who we are.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the Ameri<b>ca</b>n Dream.</li><li>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and s<b>ca</b>ndal and corruption in our government.</li><li>No longer <b>ca</b>n we assume that a high-school edu<b>ca</b>tion is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-edu<b>ca</b>ted student in Bangalore or Beijing.</li><li>No more <b>ca</b>n we count on employers to provide health <b>ca</b>re and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.</li><li>Never again <b>ca</b>n we expect the oceans that surround Ameri<b>ca</b> to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.</li><li>We've seen the cost of health <b>ca</b>re and child <b>ca</b>re and gasoline skyrocket.</li><li>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who <b>ca</b>n't afford his college dreams.</li><li>Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we <b>ca</b>re, and we're not gonna settle anymore.</li><li>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back Ameri<b>ca</b> conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.</li><li>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republi<b>ca</b>ns have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:<br>Had enough?</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use I think we've all had enough.</li><li>Enough of the <b>ca</b>n't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance.</li><li>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we <b>ca</b>n find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we <b>ca</b>n't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemi<b>ca</b>l plants or our borders.</li><li>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we <b>ca</b>n't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who <b>ca</b>n't pay their medi<b>ca</b>l bills.</li><li>I've had enough of being told that we <b>ca</b>n't afford body armor for our troops and health <b>ca</b>re for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.</li><li>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we <b>ca</b>n't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.</li><li>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their <b>ca</b>rs and begging FEMA for trailers.</li><li>And I've had enough of being told that all we <b>ca</b>n do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.</li><li>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 <b>ca</b>mpaign that he was against nation-building.</li><li>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is be<b>ca</b>use they think government is the problem.</li><li>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health <b>ca</b>re, your own retirement security, your own child <b>ca</b>re, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...</li><li>It's <b>ca</b>lled the Ownership Society in Washington.</li><li>It allows us to say to those whose health <b>ca</b>re or tuition may rise faster than they <b>ca</b>n afford - life isn't fair.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>ns know this.</li><li>We know that government <b>ca</b>n't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.</li><li>But we also know that there are some things we <b>ca</b>n't do on our own.</li><li>We know that we've been <b>ca</b>lled in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.</li><li>That's what Ameri<b>ca</b> is.</li><li>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republi<b>ca</b>n Party over what this country is about.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use I think that this is our moment to lead.</li><li>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every Ameri<b>ca</b>n an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long edu<b>ca</b>tion - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.</li><li>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health <b>ca</b>re for all Ameri<b>ca</b>ns.</li><li>The party that won't make Ameri<b>ca</b>ns choose between a health <b>ca</b>re plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.</li><li>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who <b>ca</b>n't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health <b>ca</b>re system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they <b>ca</b>n afford.</li><li>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid <b>ca</b>rs to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.</li><li>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people about why we are there and how we will win.</li><li>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest <b>ca</b>n write the biggest check.</li><li>If we do all this, if we <b>ca</b>n be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an Ameri<b>ca</b>n agenda.</li><li>Be<b>ca</b>use in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Ameri<b>ca</b>ns.</li><li>We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideologi<b>ca</b>l walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>ns everywhere are desperate for leadership.</li><li>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, be<b>ca</b>use there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.</li><li>We are here tonight be<b>ca</b>use we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.</li><li>Our time to write a new chapter in the Ameri<b>ca</b>n story.</li><li>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they <b>ca</b>n say that this was the time when Ameri<b>ca</b> renewed its purpose.</li><li>They <b>ca</b>n say that this was the time when Ameri<b>ca</b> found its way.</li><li>They <b>ca</b>n say that this was the time when Ameri<b>ca</b> learned to dream again.</li><li>The first time I <b>ca</b>me to Kenya was in 1987.</li><li>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chi<b>ca</b>go, and was about to enroll in law school.</li><li>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I <b>ca</b>me to stay with her for a month.</li><li>Instead of a motor<b>ca</b>de, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old.</li><li>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis <b>ca</b>me to fix it by the side of the road.</li><li>But it was a magi<b>ca</b>l trip.</li><li>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was <b>ca</b>lled "boy" by his employers for most of his life.</li><li>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" <b>ca</b>mps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.</li><li>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village <b>ca</b>lled Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult.</li><li>In many ways, he embodied the new Afri<b>ca</b> of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.</li><li>And yet, I discovered that for all his edu<b>ca</b>tion, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.</li><li>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and be<b>ca</b>use he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.</li><li>And on a more personal level, be<b>ca</b>use he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - be<b>ca</b>use he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.</li><li>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the Afri<b>ca</b>n continent as a whole.</li><li>The history of Afri<b>ca</b> is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Afri<b>ca</b>, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.</li><li>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the Afri<b>ca</b>n continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.</li><li>How <b>ca</b>n we explain this fact?</li><li>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire Afri<b>ca</b>n continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.</li><li>Kenya, like many Afri<b>ca</b>n nations did not come of age under the best histori<b>ca</b>l circumstances.</li><li>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the politi<b>ca</b>l and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.</li><li>This means that the edu<b>ca</b>tion and health <b>ca</b>re systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.</li><li>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Afri<b>ca</b>'s geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.</li><li>When Afri<b>ca</b>n nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had de<b>ca</b>des of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.</li><li>As a result, many Afri<b>ca</b>n nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without recipro<b>ca</b>l concessions from mature economies.</li><li>This lack of access for Afri<b>ca</b>'s agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth.</li><li>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human <b>ca</b>pital have also been major factors.</li><li>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Afri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>It <b>ca</b>nnot wait for other nations to act first.</li><li>Among Afri<b>ca</b>n nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.</li><li>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in criti<b>ca</b>l cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.</li><li>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is be<b>ca</b>use today that freedom is in jeopardy.</li><li>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an Afri<b>ca</b>n problem.</li><li>My own city of Chi<b>ca</b>go has been the home of some of the most corrupt lo<b>ca</b>l politics in Ameri<b>ca</b>n history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.</li><li>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off s<b>ca</b>rce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster edu<b>ca</b>tion systems, and strengthen public health.</li><li>It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they <b>ca</b>nnot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.</li><li>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs lo<b>ca</b>l firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.</li><li>What's worse - corruption <b>ca</b>n also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.</li><li>It <b>ca</b>n shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.</li><li>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who <b>ca</b>n be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.</li><li>Some of the worst actors on the international stage <b>ca</b>n also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purifi<b>ca</b>tion, but deliver totalitarianism.</li><li>In the end, if the people <b>ca</b>nnot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.</li><li>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly signifi<b>ca</b>ntly in Kenya.</li><li>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a criti<b>ca</b>l issue.</li><li>Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that <b>ca</b>me to power in the December elections of 2002.</li><li>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg s<b>ca</b>ndal, the <b>ca</b>lls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.</li><li>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that <b>ca</b>n enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.</li><li>Wealth declarations do little good if no one <b>ca</b>n access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allo<b>ca</b>ted to a given project in the first place.</li><li>An accountable, transparent government <b>ca</b>n break this cycle.</li><li>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest <b>ca</b>n lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.</li><li>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we <b>ca</b>n all work together to demand what should be.</li><li>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that <b>ca</b>n build a great country, a great future.</li><li>This is the Kenya that so many who <b>ca</b>me before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.</li><li>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you <b>ca</b>n imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you <b>ca</b>n to right the wrongs you see.</li><li>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from Ameri<b>ca</b> when I was still young.</li><li>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I <b>ca</b>n.</li><li>Throughout Ameri<b>ca</b>n history, there have been moments that <b>ca</b>ll on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.</li><li>In each <b>ca</b>se, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people ?</li><li>A few Tuesdays ago, the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people embraced this seriousness with regards to Ameri<b>ca</b>’s policy in Iraq.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>ns were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part be<b>ca</b>use of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part be<b>ca</b>use they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.</li><li>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a politi<b>ca</b>l football are over.</li><li>the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?</li><li>2,867 Ameri<b>ca</b>ns have now died in this war.</li><li>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before Ameri<b>ca</b>n troops arrived.</li><li>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on Ameri<b>ca</b>.</li><li>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Ameri<b>ca</b>ns demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?</li><li>The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideologi<b>ca</b>l fantasy.</li><li>When I <b>ca</b>me here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of Ameri<b>ca</b>n troops from Iraqi soil.</li><li>Senators, Republi<b>ca</b>n and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of signifi<b>ca</b>nt transition in Iraq.</li><li>What we have seen instead is a year of signifi<b>ca</b>nt deterioration.</li><li>A year in which well-respected Republi<b>ca</b>ns like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.</li><li>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what <b>ca</b>n be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.</li><li>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet Ameri<b>ca</b>n troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.</li><li>The addition of 4,000 Ameri<b>ca</b>n troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.</li><li>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on Ameri<b>ca</b>n soldiers.</li><li>“rejected the notion of an Ameri<b>ca</b>n ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi politi<b>ca</b>l issues; ordered Ameri<b>ca</b>n commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped Ameri<b>ca</b>n soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Ameri<b>ca</b>ns for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”<br>This is now the reality of Iraq.</li><li>Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we <b>ca</b>n begin to build a bipartisan consensus.</li><li>There are no options that do not <b>ca</b>rry signifi<b>ca</b>nt risks.</li><li>Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other criti<b>ca</b>l threats to our security.</li><li>And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of Ameri<b>ca</b>n resolve.</li><li>The Ameri<b>ca</b>n people have been extraordinarily resolved.</li><li>It may be politi<b>ca</b>lly advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we <b>ca</b>n still achieve in Iraq.</li><li>namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a politi<b>ca</b>l settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops <b>ca</b>n come home.</li><li>And, while some have proposed es<b>ca</b>lating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.</li><li>It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a signifi<b>ca</b>nt period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding Ameri<b>ca</b>n forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.</li><li>The Ameri<b>ca</b>n soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</li><li>But even as they have <b>ca</b>rried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.</li><li>Our troops <b>ca</b>n help suppress the violence, but they <b>ca</b>nnot solve its root <b>ca</b>uses.</li><li>I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a politi<b>ca</b>l one.</li><li>To reach such a solution, we must communi<b>ca</b>te clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.</li><li>No more coddling, no more equivo<b>ca</b>tion.</li><li>to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a politi<b>ca</b>l agreement between the warring factions that <b>ca</b>n create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.</li><li>When I first advo<b>ca</b>ted steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.</li><li>For only through this phased redeployment <b>ca</b>n we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?</li><li>that it will be up to them to form a viable government that <b>ca</b>n effectively run and secure Iraq.</li><li>We <b>ca</b>nnot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.</li><li>The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective politi<b>ca</b>l arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.</li><li>Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put Ameri<b>ca</b>n troops in danger.</li><li>By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s <b>ca</b>ll for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this criti<b>ca</b>l fight against terrorism.</li><li>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedi<b>ca</b>ted to the criti<b>ca</b>l, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, criti<b>ca</b>l infrastructure, and Ameri<b>ca</b>n enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</li><li>In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a signifi<b>ca</b>ntly reduced U.S. force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time.</li><li>But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a politi<b>ca</b>l solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?</li><li>An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles <b>ca</b>n guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the lo<b>ca</b>l populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.</li><li>In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government <b>ca</b>n function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, <b>ca</b>n prevent an es<b>ca</b>lation of widespread sectarian killing.</li><li>We <b>ca</b>n teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.</li><li>standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only <b>ca</b>use the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.</li><li>The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a politi<b>ca</b>l settlement.</li><li>But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in Ameri<b>ca</b>n history.</li><li>Today, the Iraqi lands<b>ca</b>pe is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.</li><li>But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting politi<b>ca</b>l settlement.</li><li>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a politi<b>ca</b>l solution.</li><li>if the Iranians and Syrians think they <b>ca</b>n use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.</li><li>As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about Ameri<b>ca</b>’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.</li><li>The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we <b>ca</b>n impose democracy on a country through military force.</li><li>In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyranni<b>ca</b>l regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.</li><li>This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we <b>ca</b>n, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.</li><li><b>ca</b>nnot be built overnight, and they <b>ca</b>nnot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.</li><li>Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what politi<b>ca</b>l situation we would find after Baghdad fell.</li><li>But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that <b>ca</b>n lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.</li><li>We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats Ameri<b>ca</b> now faces ?</li><li>threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to be<b>ca</b>use we have been distracted in Iraq.</li><li>The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take <b>ca</b>re of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.</li><li>In my travels to Afri<b>ca</b>, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that <b>ca</b>n be exploited by al Qaeda.</li><li>And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biologi<b>ca</b>l and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.</li><li>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the Ameri<b>ca</b>n people.</li><li>According to a Pew survey, 42% of Ameri<b>ca</b>ns now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they <b>ca</b>n on their own.”<br>We <b>ca</b>nnot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.</li><li>Ameri<b>ca</b>ns <b>ca</b>lled for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.</li><li>And it is time to refocus Ameri<b>ca</b>’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.</li><li>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that be<b>ca</b>me particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.</li><li>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biologi<b>ca</b>l weapons program.</li><li>Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left s<b>ca</b>ttered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.</li><li>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we <b>ca</b>n imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.</li><li>And that is why the nuclear, chemi<b>ca</b>l, and biologi<b>ca</b>l weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.</li><li>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we <b>ca</b>n do this.</li><li>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drasti<b>ca</b>lly different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?</li><li>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety <b>ca</b>tastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.</li><li>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that <b>ca</b>n be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiologi<b>ca</b>l devices -- under control and dramati<b>ca</b>lly reduce the proliferation threat they pose.</li><li>I want to turn to a second criti<b>ca</b>l area: biologi<b>ca</b>l weapons threat reduction programs.</li><li>Besides the devastation they <b>ca</b>n <b>ca</b>use to a civilian population, biologi<b>ca</b>l agents <b>ca</b>n also be effective in asymmetri<b>ca</b>l warfare against U.S. troops.</li><li>But be<b>ca</b>use of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biologi<b>ca</b>l weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.</li><li>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medi<b>ca</b>l countermeasures.</li><li>As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biologi<b>ca</b>l threats.</li><li>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biologi<b>ca</b>l, and chemi<b>ca</b>l weapons.</li><li>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Afri<b>ca</b> to Afghanistan.</li><li>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think criti<b>ca</b>lly and strategi<b>ca</b>lly about Washington's relationship with Moscow.</li><li>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we <b>ca</b>nnot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.</li><li>Outstanding <b>ca</b>reer officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.</li><li>It means that the Russians <b>ca</b>n and should do more to support these programs.</li><li>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biologi<b>ca</b>l threat reduction.</li><li>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at Ameri<b>ca</b>n University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.</li><li>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences <b>ca</b>n be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.</li></ul></td>

whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can some<b>day</b> watch your child receive her college diploma.</li><li>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a <b>day</b> off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</li><li>And to<b>day</b>, we import triple the amount of oil as the <b>day</b> that Senator McCain took office.</li><li>Now is the time to help families with paid sick <b>day</b>s and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</li><li>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal <b>day</b>'s work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</li><li>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just <b>day</b>s after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.</li><li>And to<b>day</b>, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</li><li>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a <b>day</b> than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</li><li>And it is that promise that forty five years ago to<b>day</b>, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</li><li>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together to<b>day</b> and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America.</li><li>My friends, we meet here to<b>day</b> at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history.</li><li>And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life to<b>day</b>.</li><li>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that some<b>day</b> it would be her turn.</li><li>And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a <b>day</b> of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.</li><li>She saw four little girls die in a Sun<b>day</b> school and catalyze a nation.</li><li>And I think that we face one of those moments to<b>day</b>.</li><li>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sun<b>day</b> schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.</li><li>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she some<b>day</b> has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?</li><li>And then some<b>day</b>, some<b>day</b>, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.</li><li>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the <b>day</b>s of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.</li><li>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a <b>day</b>, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.</li><li>To<b>day</b>, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's.</li><li>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because to<b>day</b> that freedom is in jeopardy.</li><li>To<b>day</b>, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.</li><li>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy to<b>day</b>.</li><li>In to<b>day</b>'s Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's <b>day</b> - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.</li><li>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the <b>day</b>s and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.</li><li>A few Tues<b>day</b>s ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</li><li>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the <b>day</b>s of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</li><li>the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing <b>day</b> ?</li><li>They are doing so to<b>day</b>.</li><li>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the <b>day</b>s of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.</li><li>To<b>day</b>, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.</li><li>In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue to<b>day</b>.</li><li>Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tues<b>day</b>s ago.</li><li>I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did to<b>day</b>.</li><li>To<b>day</b>, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.</li><li>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves to<b>day</b> is, what is the future of this program?</li><li>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the <b>day</b>s and years to come?</li><li>Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this <b>day</b> - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.</li></ul></td>
